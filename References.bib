abstract = {Neuronal computation is energetically expensive. Consequently, the brain's limited energy supply imposes constraints on its information processing capability. Most brain energy is used on synaptic transmission, making it important to understand how energy is provided to and used by synapses. We describe how information transmission through presynaptic terminals and postsynaptic spines is related to their energy consumption, assess which mechanisms normally ensure an adequate supply of {ATP} to these structures, consider the influence of synaptic plasticity and changing brain state on synaptic energy use, and explain how disruption of the energy supply to synapses leads to neuropathology.

abstract = {In the auditory system, type I spiral ganglion neurons ({SGNs}) convey complex acoustic information from inner hair cells ({IHCs}) to the brainstem. Although {SGNs} exhibit variation in physiological and anatomical properties, it is unclear which features are endogenous and which reflect input from synaptic partners. Using single-cell {RNA} sequencing, we derived a molecular classification of mouse type I {SGNs} comprising three subtypes that express unique combinations of Ca2+ binding proteins, ion channel regulators, guidance molecules, and transcription factors. Based on connectivity and susceptibility to age-related loss, these subtypes correspond to those defined physiologically. Additional intrinsic differences among subtypes and across the tonotopic axis highlight an unexpectedly active role for {SGNs} in auditory processing. {SGN} identities emerge postnatally and are disrupted in a mouse model of deafness that lacks {IHC}-driven activity. These results elucidate the range, nature, and origins of {SGN} diversity, with implications for treatment of congenital deafness. Copyright \copyright 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}

abstract = {The murine Unp gene encodes a ubiquitin-specific protease, a member of a family of enzymes that includes the product of the human tre-2 oncogene. The Unp gene has previously been mapped to chromosome 9. We have cloned in bacteriophage a 50 kilobase region of chromosome 9 containing the Unp gene, and have determined the nucleotide sequence of the gene. The gene has 22 exons, distributed over 47.4 kb. A processed ribosomal S2 pseudogene was identified in the third intron of the Unp gene. Expression of Unp is driven by a {GC}-rich, 'housekeeping' type promoter. Copyright 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.
